# Liver and Liver Cancer Segmentation

This repositorty provides a minimal working example of the liver and liver cancer segmentation nnU-Net models, a series of tools for the segmentation of such anatomies from contrast-enhanced CT images. The model was trained using 201 contrast-enhanced CT images from several clinical sites. The dataset included a variety of primary cancers, pre- and post-therapy images, with variable volume size, field of view, slice thickness, and the presence of metal artefacts.
