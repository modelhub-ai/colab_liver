# Abdominal Organs at Risk Segmentation

This repositorty provides a example notebook of the abdominal organs at risk segmentation nnU-Net models, a series of tools for the segmentation of 13 abdominal organs from contrast-enhanced CT images. The model was trained using 50 abdomen CT scans of selected from various clinical trials. The scans were captured during portal venous contrast phase, with variable volume size, field of view, and slice thickness.
